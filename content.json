I will update this plan regularly to add links to finished articles. Computer scienceAs a computer science student, it is natural to record the knowledge learnt and organize them in a way for future review. I am planning to focus on below topics in the following year: Algorithms &amp; Data structures Articles about this topic should serve as cheat sheet when preparing for technical interviews. I will try to combine typical problems using different algorithms and data structures with theoretical knowledge. Machine learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Articles on this topic could be: concept/algorithm definition, practical example, literature review, collected resources, etc. Database &amp; SQL Knowledge about SQL in particular could be forgotten if not used regularly.
