SummaryFor the past few months, I have been busy finishing coursework in school and preparing application materials for masters. As the application procedure draw to their deadlines, together with a new semester with less courses, a lot free time could be expected. To make use of those free time and be organized in blogging, I uploaded this blog plan to motivate myself writing and sharing my ideas both in computer science field and other interesting fields I encountered. It could also be used to track my progress during next year. Below are tasks in different areas. Some may be added or modified due to technical difficulty or change of mind. Blog constructionI would like to outline a few tasks to advance my blog’s functionalities: Add RSS feeds Add share link Support different languages (Chinese and English sites) Tags &amp; Categories construction SEO (Search engine optimization) design … ContentI would like to upload some series of articles to share my ideas in different areas. I will update this plan regularly to add links to finished articles. Computer scienceAs a computer science student, it is natural to record the knowledge learnt and organize them in a way for future review. I am planning to focus on below topics in the following year: Algorithms &amp; Data structures Articles about this topic should serve as cheat sheet when preparing for technical interviews. I will try to combine typical problems using different algorithms and data structures with theoretical knowledge. Machine learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Articles on this topic could be: concept/algorithm definition, practical example, literature review, collected resources, etc. Database &amp; SQL Knowledge about SQL in particular could be forgotten if not used regularly. I would like to record some basic grammars for SQL and some concepts in database management. Notes in past four years As I am graduating from computer science program, I find it necessary and valuable to review the courses and the notes I took. Self-managementExcept for professional knowledge, I would like to share ideas about how I managed myself. It would cover the topic of time management, task management, information management, knowledge management, etc. Topics like software choice, workflows, general methodologies could also be expected. BookI would like to share the books I read and the notes I took. Books to share notes: How to Take Smart Notes One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - For Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers by Sönke Ahrens Getting Things Done The Art of Stress-Free Productivity Penguin by David Allen Books to read: Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick &amp; Kevin Wayne … TimelineFor blog construction tasks, I would like to complete them before February. And for the topics of computer science field, I would be uploading articles regularly across all year. And for the first two topics, I see the majority of work done by July. As for self-management and book sharing, I would be uploading articles when I think a mature idea was formed to be shared and discussed.","link":"/2021/12/29/Blog-Plan-for-2022/"},{"title":"Intention of this blog","text":"Aims Record feelings and findings during CS study.

Special thanks to Codesheep’s video 0. Pre-requisiteThe most important of all, don’t be afraid of making mistakes! To initiate your blog, you will need the libraries below. 0.1 Node.js Download here - suggest LTS version To check whether Node.js was downloaded successfully, type node -v in the terminal window. If something like v12.18.2 is presented with no error message, you are free to go for the next step. For Windows users, terminal could be invoked by pressing win + R, and then type cmd in the prompt window. 0.2 npmnpm is the default package management tool for Node.js. For Chinese users, you could switch to the mirror in cnpm for faster downloads. Run the command to install cnpm: 1$ npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org Similar to Node.js, type npm -v to check if it’s installed successfully. 0.3 Gitgit is a version control tool used widely among programming projects. Generally speaking, it could help you keep different versions of your project. Download here To configure the git globally, you could run the command after installation. In the command, --global would set the following parameters for all git repositories on your computer. 12$ git config --global user.name &quot;Your Namee&quot;$ git config --global user.email &quot;email@example.com&quot; 0.4 hexoWith the package management tool installed, fetch the hexo package using command: 1$ npm install -g hexo or: 1$ cnpm install -g hexo Similar to Node.js, type hexo -v to check if it’s installed successfully. 1. Initiate blog Create a folder 1$ mkdir blog By default, this blog/ folder will be created in /Users/YourUserName/ for both Mac and Windows users. Navigate into the folder 1$ cd blog To check if you are in the right folder, type pwd to check. Initiate your blog ==Make sure you are in the right folder before running command below!== 1$ sudo hexo init The sudo parameter refers to admin access. Run your blog! 1$ hexo s By default, you will see the blog running at http://localhost:4000 2. Create a new articleAs indicated in the default blog file helloworld.md, you could use the command below to create a new blog. 1$ hexo n &quot;Your artical title&quot; By default, it will be created in source/_posts folder. For markdown reference, please check here. After writing, use the following command to clean the database and generate static files for local blog. 123$ hexo clean$ hexo generate$ hexo server Vist the default link again, you could see the article you just wrote. 3. Deploy your blog You will need a Github account or Gitee accound for deployment. Github Create a new repository with the name YourFullUserName.github.io and it has to be set to public. Install a plugin for deployment. 1$ npm install --save hexo-deployer-git Find the _config.yml file in your blog folder, at the end of this file, modify the following content: 123456# Deployment## Docs: https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.htmldeploy: type: git repo: Your Github repo's link branch: master Your repo link should end with .github.io.git which you could obtain here. After saving your config file, run command below to deploy your blog. 1$ hexo d You may need to type your user name and password. See you blog online!

Defining Operating SystemsWhat can an OS do for me? File systems: where is the file physically written on the disk and how is it retrieved? Abstraction: why looks the instruction the same independent of the device? Concurrency: what if multiple programs access the same file simultaneously? What if an other process starts running? Security: why is the access denied? Where in memory will the array be stored and how is it protected from unauthorised access? What if the array requires more memory than physically available? What if only part of the array is currently in use ? What is part of the operating system?Memory management, CPU scheduling, file system, communication, memory management, interrupt handling, GUI, . . . A resource manager Many modern operating systems use multi-programming to improve user experience and maximize resource utilization Disks are slow: without multi-programming, CPU time is wasted while waiting for I/O requests Imagine a CPU running at 3.2 GHz (approx. 3:2 $\\times$ 109 instructions per second) Imagine a disk rotating at 7200 RPM, taking 4.2 ms to rotate half a track I/O is slow, we are missing out on 3.2 $\\times$ 4.2 $\\times$ $10^6$ instructions (13.44m)! The implementation of multi-programming has important consequences for operating system design The operating system must allocate/share resources (including CPU, memory, I/O devices) fairly and safely between competing processes: In time, e.g. CPUs and printers In space, e.g., memory and disks The execution of multiple programs (processes) needs to be interleaved with one another: This requires context switches and process scheduling ) $\\Rightarrow$ mutual exclusion, deadlock avoidance, protection, . . OriginIn the early days, programmers had to deal directly with the hardware Real computer hardware is ugly Hardware is extremely difficult to manipulate/program ==An operating system is a layer of indirection on top of the hardware==: It provide abstractions for application programs (e.g., file systems) It provides a cleaner and easier interface to the hardware and hides the complexity of “bare metal” It allows the programmer to be lazy by using common routines :-) Why study operating system? The programs that we write use operating system functionality How are the operating system’s services/abstractions implemented Computer Architecture Simplified computer model (Tanenbaum, 2014) CPU design CPU’s basic cycle consist of fetch, decode, and execute (pipelines, or superscalar) Every CPU has his own instruction set A CPU has a set of registers (extremely fast memory close to the CPU “core”) Registers are used to store data and for special functions (e.g. program counter, program status word – mode bit) The compiler/programmer decides what to keep in the registers Context switching must save and restore the CPU’s internal state, including its registers Memory management Unit There are two different address spaces: the logical address space seen by the process and used by the compiler the physical address space seen by the hardware/OS When compiling code, memory addresses must be assigned to variables and instructions, the compiler does not know what memory addresses will be available in physical memory It will just assume that the code will start running at address 0 when generating the machine code On some rare occasions, the process may run at physical address 0 physical address = logical address + 0 On other occasions, it will be running at a completely different location in physical memory and an offset is added physical address = logical address + offset The memory management unit(MMU) is responsible for address translation (“adding the offset”) Different processes require different address translation (offsets) Context switching requires the MMU to be updated (and registers, cache, …) Example1234567891011#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int iVar = 0;void main() { int i = 0; while(i &lt; 10) { iVar++; sleep(2); printf(&quot;Address:%u; Value:%d\\n&quot;,&amp;iVar, iVar); i++; }} The same addresses will be displayed for iVar. The address printed on the screen is the logical address The value for iVar in the first run doesn’t influence the second run’s value Moore’s Law “The number of transistors on an integrated circuit (chip) doubles roughly every two years” Closely linked, but not necessarily related to performance Moore’s still continuing, but the “power wall” slows performance improvements of single core/single processor systems A few cores for multiple “programs” is easy to justify How to use massively parallel computers/CPUs/many core machines Can we extract parallelism automatically, can we implement parallelism at the lowest level (similar to multiprogramming) Lead to multi-core / parallel development Multi-core, hyperthreaded processors Modern CPUs contain multiple cores and are often hyper-threaded Evolution in hardware has implications on operating system design XP did not support multi processor architectures Process scheduling needs to account for load balancing and CPU affinity Cache coherency becomes important (manage run-time data) Previous exam: Describe how, in your opinion, recent developments in computerarchitecture and computer design have influenced operating system design Timer Interrupts Interrupts temporarily pause a process’s normal operation Different types of interrupts exist, including: Timer interrupts by CPU clock I/O interrupts for I/O completion or error codes Software generated, e.g. errors and exceptions Context switches (i.e. switching between processes) can be initiated by timer interrupts after a “set time” Timer generates an interrupt CPU finishes current instruction and tests for interrupt Transfer to interrupt service routine Hardware saves current process state (PSW, program counter) Set program counter to interrupt service routine Save registers and other state information Carry out interrupt service routine (scheduler) Restore next process to run","link":"/2020/10/04/OSC%20Lecture%20Notes%20-%20Introduction/"}],"tags":[{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","link":"/tags/blog/"},{"name":"translation","slug":"translation","link":"/tags/translation/"},{"name":"Operating System","slug":"Operating-System","link":"/tags/Operating-System/"},{"name":"Note","slug":"Note","link":"/tags/Note/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Computer Science","slug":"Computer-Science","link":"/categories/Computer-Science/"}]}
