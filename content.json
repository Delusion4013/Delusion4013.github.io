When I talk about Information Era, I am not referring to the time when information technology explodes, but after that, when we are overwhelmed by massive information. According to relevant study, modern citizens percieve one million times more information than citizens back in 1000 A.D. The development of all medium and the widespread of personal computer contributes to the astonishing increase of information available. Therefore, I would like to focus on this aspect and demonstrate my understanding and methodology. ## Understanding of Information eraWhat is information? Information is from which data and knowledge can be derived, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. Characteristic of information Information is infinite, quickly-updated Compare to the limited time and effort each individual possess, the massive information generated each day and accumulated in the past seems infinite. Different information may be contradicting Due to different perspective and former knowledge, ones could have different views on the same thing. For example, in stock market, it is common that a lot of reviewers have contradicting views on whether the market is bearish or bullish. The capture &amp; storage of information takes time and effort According to its definition, understanding and extracting the useful piece of information need human’s time and effort. Besides, the form of information varies, such as videos, articles, audios, etc. Handling different forms of information also requires individual’s time and effort. Methodology in this eraRegarding to the [characteristic of information](### Characteristic of information), I have formed the below methodology. Be selective and make decision with sufficient information As the information is infinite, we need to be astute when capturing information. This involves finding relevant information quickly (using search engine) and selecting those important ones that is most suitable for current situation. The thought of coming with a ‘perfect’ plan should be abandoned. Since the available information is infinite, you could always use other source to perfect your plan further. The best way to do this would be quickly draft a plan, starting implement it and continue with iterative perfection based on the feedback from your practice. Develop critical thinking and make independent judgments Due to the possible conflicting views from different information source, you need to develop the ability of critical thinking. You should evaluate views from different sides, find their reasoning and process, and then based on your experience and knowledge to make a informed decision. Form your own workflow for the capture, organize and induction of information Capture info: Search Engine TechniquesAccording to research, 90% of the people didn’t realize the below usage of search engine. You could customize your search via simple formatting of your query, which would largely reduce the time you find relevant information. Search for key phrases “” Wrap up your phrase with “” to search the entire phrase rather than search word by word. Exclude key phrases - Use a - before the keyword you would like to exclude. Searching for synonyms ~ Place the ~ in front of the search term. Using AND OR logic Place keyword AND OR between search terms to indicate whether you want all of them or part of them to appear in the search result. Using grammar to filter result Suppose you want to find something in a particular website, use the keyword site:. E.g. Awesome Computer Science Courses site:github.com Suppose you want to find something in specific file type, use the keyword filetype:. E.g. How to take smart notes filetype:pdf Suppose you want to find related websites (have similar content), use the keyword related:. E.g. Suppose you want your search term to appear in the title of the search result, use the keyword intitle:. Organizing info: Categorization and Using toolsCategorizationInspiration of this idea comes from David Allen’s book introducing GTD method. One of the principle in GTD is to collect all the things (to-dos, reference materials, action reminder, etc.) in one place and categorize them later to maintain organized. It is the same for organizing the information you captured. To make use of them later, you should categorize them into different categories based on its type (video or article) or its topic. The categorization process would help you find relevant information later. Literature management toolsAs for me, I like to keep a record of the original copy of the information source, such as a journal article or a video, for later review. Therefore the literature management tools (in my case, Zotero) help me a lot. With Zotero (or other similar tools like Citavi, endnote), you could Capture journal articles using DOIs or ISBN, and websites or blog through browser extension. Cite your reference in Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, etc. Sync your references cross-platform Manage your notes for different entries Extracting info: Knowledge managementOnly digested information is valuable and reusable. Another name for this would be knowledge. Sometimes you need to express the information in your own language to see if you understand them fully (Feynman method of learning). In AI field, knowledge management is implemented using Triples ((Subject,predicate,object) such as (wheel, part of, cars)) and reasoning rules, and these basic units together forms a larger semantic web or knowledge graph. This is some how instructive on how you manage your personal knowledge -&gt; make each note atomic and then forms a larger repository. As for individuals, managing reusable knowledge requires note taking strategies. A field called PKM (Personal Knowledge management) focuses on solve this issue. I would discuss my understanding of PKM and my methodology in a later article.","link":"/2022/03/13/Embrace%20the%20Information%20Era/"},{"title":"Binary search algorithm","text":"In this post, I will give a brief summary of binary search algorithm, together with some programming problems on this topic. Algorithm Introduction It is a simple recursive searching algorithm. Scope of application: in ordered arrays The pseudo code1 is as follows: 123456789101112131415161718Procedure binary_search A ← sorted array n ← size of array x ← value to be searched Set lowerBound = 1 Set upperBound = n while x not found if upperBound &lt; lowerBound EXIT: x does not exists. set midPoint = lowerBound + ( upperBound - lowerBound ) / 2 if A[midPoint] &lt; x set lowerBound = midPoint + 1 if A[midPoint] &gt; x set upperBound = midPoint - 1 if A[midPoint] = x EXIT: x found at location midPoint end while In plain words, it recursively check whether the mid point value is the target, if the target is bigger, check the left half; if the target is smaller, check the right half. Complexity Space complexity Only constant number of variables are used, therefore the space complexity is $O(1)$. Time complexity Because each time after search, half of the array would be ‘discarded’, therefore the overall complexity is $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array.

Further to my internship experience and my reading on the web, I have concluded some information about index system. 1. What is Index System?For example, when deciding whether a company is worth investing, you would see comments like “This company has too much loans”, “It is not making any profits”. However in data-driven industries (like finance), you need to support your decisions with intuitive evidence. Instead of raw business data, an index should be used for demonstration purposes (e.g. Asset-liability ratio).In the above example, the index of asset-liability ration addresses the company’s debt. In real world problem, complicate problem could not be resolved by using one single index (e.g. Evaluating a company’s future profitability), therefore a set of indexes is needed to describe the data subject from different perspectives and lead to a informed decision, that is where index system plays a role. 2. How is index system useful?When evaluating one’s health condition, we tend to use the indicators like body fat percentage, body temperature, blood pressure, etc. Considering these indicators together, one’s health status could then be determined. It’s the same when using index system to evaluate a company. When something goes wrong, the index system should be able to reflect this abnormality. Tracing down the problematic index that goes wrong, the current problem in business should be clear. And then the relevant department could have the right direction to improve on. In summary, the index system should achieve the following: Monitor business situation Find problems based on problematic index Evaluate business and guide the future work. 3. How to build an index system?The general approach is as following: Understand company’s / department’s Key Performance Indicator (KPI), define Level-1 Index Understand the business, dismantle Level-1 Index and define Level-2 Index Sort out business processes, dismantle Level-2 Index and define Level-3 Index Using reports to monitor index system, update it accordingly 4. Common mistakes when building index system Not understand the KPI No logic relationship between indexes Dissembled indexes has no business meaning Little or No communication between data department and business department Reference Zhihu’s passage - How to build an index system by Houzi","link":"/2021/09/27/Index%20System%20Introduction/"},{"title":"Intention of this blog","text":"Aims Record feelings and findings during CS study.

Structure of Cryptography Symmetric Cryptography Same key for encryption and decryption Ensures confidentiality Implemented via block ciphers or stream ciphers Lightweight and fast Used for general communication Stream CiphersImplementation Initial seed key to generate an infinite keystream of random bits Using same keystream to encrypt two messages -&gt; easy to break A random “number used once” ( nonce ) added as additional seed -&gt; ensure keystream is new Message &amp; keystream combined using XOR to get the cipher text ==XOR is reversible is applied twice==, which brings much convenience when decrypt cipher text. Advantages Encrypting long continuous streams, possibly of unknown length Extremely fast with a low memory footprint, ideal for low-power devices If designed well, can seek to any location in the stream Disadvantages The keystream must appear statistically random You must *never* reuse a key + nonce Stream ciphers do not protect the ciphertext Therefore, message could be manipulated during transition without breaking confidentiality E.g., suppose you are transmitting a message to bank saying A owes you $50. Attacker could either manipulate the amount or the creditor using the same stream ciper or resent the same message to server.

Defining Operating SystemsWhat can an OS do for me? File systems: where is the file physically written on the disk and how is it retrieved?

A resource manager Many modern operating systems use multi-programming to improve user experience and maximize resource utilization Disks are slow: without multi-programming, CPU time is wasted while waiting for I/O requests Imagine a CPU running at 3.2 GHz (approx. 3:2 $\\times$ 109 instructions per second) Imagine a disk rotating at 7200 RPM, taking 4.2 ms to rotate half a track I/O is slow, we are missing out on 3.2 $\\times$ 4.2 $\\times$ $10^6$ instructions (13.44m)! The implementation of multi-programming has important consequences for operating system design The operating system must allocate/share resources (including CPU, memory, I/O devices) fairly and safely between competing processes: In time, e.g. CPUs and printers In space, e.g., memory and disks The execution of multiple programs (processes) needs to be interleaved with one another: This requires context switches and process scheduling ) $\\Rightarrow$ mutual exclusion, deadlock avoidance, protection, . . OriginIn the early days, programmers had to deal directly with the hardware Real computer hardware is ugly Hardware is extremely difficult to manipulate/program ==An operating system is a layer of indirection on top of the hardware==: It provide abstractions for application programs (e.g., file systems) It provides a cleaner and easier interface to the hardware and hides the complexity of “bare metal” It allows the programmer to be lazy by using common routines :-) Why study operating system? The programs that we write use operating system functionality How are the operating system’s services/abstractions implemented Computer Architecture Simplified computer model (Tanenbaum, 2014) CPU design CPU’s basic cycle consist of fetch, decode, and execute (pipelines, or superscalar) Every CPU has his own instruction set A CPU has a set of registers (extremely fast memory close to the CPU “core”) Registers are used to store data and for special functions (e.g. program counter, program status word – mode bit) The compiler/programmer decides what to keep in the registers Context switching must save and restore the CPU’s internal state, including its registers Memory management Unit There are two different address spaces: the logical address space seen by the process and used by the compiler the physical address space seen by the hardware/OS When compiling code, memory addresses must be assigned to variables and instructions, the compiler does not know what memory addresses will be available in physical memory It will just assume that the code will start running at address 0 when generating the machine code On some rare occasions, the process may run at physical address 0 physical address = logical address + 0 On other occasions, it will be running at a completely different location in physical memory and an offset is added physical address = logical address + offset The memory management unit(MMU) is responsible for address translation (“adding the offset”) Different processes require different address translation (offsets) Context switching requires the MMU to be updated (and registers, cache, …) Example1234567891011#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int iVar = 0;void main() { int i = 0; while(i &lt; 10) { iVar++; sleep(2); printf(&quot;Address:%u; Value:%d\\n&quot;,&amp;iVar, iVar); i++; }} The same addresses will be displayed for iVar. The address printed on the screen is the logical address The value for iVar in the first run doesn’t influence the second run’s value Moore’s Law “The number of transistors on an integrated circuit (chip) doubles roughly every two years” Closely linked, but not necessarily related to performance Moore’s still continuing, but the “power wall” slows performance improvements of single core/single processor systems A few cores for multiple “programs” is easy to justify How to use massively parallel computers/CPUs/many core machines Can we extract parallelism automatically, can we implement parallelism at the lowest level (similar to multiprogramming) Lead to multi-core / parallel development Multi-core, hyperthreaded processors Modern CPUs contain multiple cores and are often hyper-threaded Evolution in hardware has implications on operating system design XP did not support multi processor architectures Process scheduling needs to account for load balancing and CPU affinity Cache coherency becomes important (manage run-time data) Previous exam: Describe how, in your opinion, recent developments in computerarchitecture and computer design have influenced operating system design Timer Interrupts Interrupts temporarily pause a process’s normal operation Different types of interrupts exist, including: Timer interrupts by CPU clock I/O interrupts for I/O completion or error codes Software generated, e.g. errors and exceptions Context switches (i.e. switching between processes) can be initiated by timer interrupts after a “set time” Timer generates an interrupt CPU finishes current instruction and tests for interrupt Transfer to interrupt service routine Hardware saves current process state (PSW, program counter) Set program counter to interrupt service routine Save registers and other state information Carry out interrupt service routine (scheduler) Restore next process to run","link":"/2020/10/04/OSC%20Lecture%20Notes%20-%20Introduction/"},{"title":"Thinking about Time management","text":"In this article, I will talk about my understanding and implementation of time management measures. Moreover, I would introduce some popular concepts of this topic, like GTD, Pomodoros,The Eisenhower Method. Understanding of Time management What it is? What’s its importance? Time management is the process of carefully planning time individuals spent on various activities. The aim of the time management is to increase efficiency and productivity. For a simple example, suppose you need to prepare dinner for your family, you need to complete a set of tasks like shopping for groceries, preparing ingridients, cooking, etc. Time management skills tend to help you reduce the overall time spent on all this tasks by arranging them consciously. In computer science, the design of operating system provides an abstraction on this topic via CPU scheduling. The priorities of tasks resembles the real life situation where some tasks is more urgent than others. The overhead of context switch (switching between tasks) is a vivid abstraction of human changing focus. For a difficult task (takes more time), it was split into more time slices to complete. Popular ConceptsThe Eisenhower MethodIt is a method that utilizes the criteria of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. Based on the two criteria, tasks could be categorized into four categories (as in following graph) Important &amp; Urgent tasks - should be done immediately and in person. Important &amp; Not Urgent tasks - should be done at certain dates and in person. Unimportant &amp; Urgent tasks - could be delegated. Unimportant &amp; Not Urgent tasks - should be dropped. In practice, it is not frequently listed but used as a mental model to decide the task’s properties. PomodorosThis method was originally from Francesco Cirillo’s Pomodoro Technique. It took the name from a Pomodoro - tomato shaped kitchen timer. The “Pomodoro” is defined as the fundamental unit of time to measure tasks’ expected completion time, which is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Though it may seems stiff to use strict pomodoros, it could actually develop your sense of time and help you record your performance. With continuous using of this technique, you could be more confident in predicting tasks’ completion time. Recoding how many Pomodoros you finished could also be a straight forward metric of evaluating your performance. GTDThis strategy was created by David Allen in his book Getting Things Done. The basic idea of this strategy is to capture all unfinished things (projects or tasks), clarify them into small actionable tasks with clear goals, organize them in appropriate forms (and come up to you at proper time), review tasks frequently to update the status and engage in these tasks. In general, it provides a complete workflow for you to manage all your tasks and projects in a personalized system. Though this system may be hard to build and maintain, from my own experience, it is worthwhile to keep you confident in action decisions. My implementation of time managementTo start with your time mangement, you frist need to be aware of where you spent your time. I used aTimeLogger to track my everyday activities. This is the start of my time management practice and could provide a clear view of whether you are hard working or playing too much. You could also pick your own time tracking app, just pay attention to the philosophy of the software to make sure they are NOT interruptive of your current activities and time-consuming when recording. To plan your time carefully and wisely, I used GTD techniques to track all the tasks I need to finish and all the events I need to participate. Following GTD’s principles, I would tag the tasks with its expected context (when would be proper, what tools needed, etc.) and group them with the assoicated project. I have tried plenty of task management apps like Omnifocus (which I am now using), Things 3, TickTick (Used for a long time), Wunderlist, etc. It is hard to give a general suggestion for the choice as different people may have different requirements, just make sure the app you choose helps record your tasks easily, intergrate nicely with your workflow and remind you in appropriate format. One more thing to care about, is DO NOT overmanaging. I had once fallen into the pitfall of overmanaging myself. I enjoyed listing and categorizing different tasks and projects, trying different apps, perfecting the tag system but just NOT complete many of those tasks. Remember what the name suggest, getting things done, so focus on completing the tasks rather than putting most of your efforts changing their organization. In the new information era, another thing has become more valuable than our time, that is, our attention (or effective time). The power of attention has long been discovered by physicist through Double-slit experiment, in which whether observer exists could impact the results of the inference pattern. Modern business are even using our attention to gain money (through online advertisement). We need to pay attention to what we paid our attention to. What you should do, is paying attention to the four things below: focusing on valuable things relationships, especially intimacy finding new trends Self development Pomodoros is therefore been introduced to my system to record my attention (though it has way more potentials as introduced above). You could easily track your progress and performance via pomodoro recoding. I am now using Session as the app to record for its elegant visualizations and ease of use.","link":"/2022/02/16/Thinking-about-time-management/"},{"title":"Thinking about writing","text":"In this article, I will rethink the importance of writing, and discuss how the tools I used evolved. Motivation In information era, the way we express ourselves matters. Different thinking pattern could be reflected from the writing. Among applications, we could use the most efficient way to express and organize our ideas. The importance of writingWriting, in its board aspect, is an everyday activity for all of us. However, according to my friends, little of us have ever thought carefully about this activity. Different format we use could help us train different thinking patterns. Different applications we chose could effect the efficiency of expressing ourselves and organizing ideas. It is also an important way for us to exchange serious opinions in a decent manner (like publications). Different format could be applied to writing. Within my knowledge, they are plain text (.txt, .word files), hypertext (.html, .md files) and outline (.opml files). Each format has an implication of different thinking pattern. For example, if you use outlining more often than other format, you are tend to be a person with a good sense of the overall picture.If you use hypertext (e.g. markdown) very often, you tend to care about the content more than the format it is presented. In Sönke Ahrens’s book , he emphasis the importance of writing: An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas. My experience in writingDuring my early life, I used Microsoft Word as my main editing tool as this is the only one I am familiar with. The software works fine, however, as I grow older, I tend to realize that I spend a lot of time editing the format for different headings and emphasis. With my exploartion in computer science, I started to use markdown as the main form of many writings. Markdown is a kind of mark up language, which uses a small set of symbols to realize the formatting. This freed me from doing manual adjustment for different parts of the text and could now focus more on the content. Markdown is also a portable format. The formatting is realized by limited symbols which allows the raw text to be readable.In my university, I have been using markdown to take notes, write reports and draft my dissertation. Though markdown itself is a powerful concept, the editor could be of great add on to this kind of writing. I have tried a lot of different markdown editors and now kept mainly two of them (Typora and Obsidian), I will write more about the reasoning of choices I made in a later post. As my writing in markdown format increases, I started to realize one drawback for this format. It is more of a connstraint in its methodology rather than software design. Markdown kinds of suggest a fragmented thinking, where each piece of markdown note stands for a concept or event solely. Though markdown provides link feature, it is not good for getting the whole picture (say you are taking notes for a course and want to have an overview before exam). This let me to another kind of writing - outlining. Compared to putting emphasis on the details, outline writing put an emphasis on the key points or the main topic. It encourages concise language choices which is helpful for letting you know the bigger picture and the key points. Using the outlining tools together with my markdown notes, I could both get an general understanding and have detailed information when refering to my notes. Later when I came accross the PKM concept, I began to use Obsidian to manage my markdown notes, which could provide two-way linking between different files.
